This is because GalaxyZoo uses human classifiers and in many cases the volunteers do not agree on a single conclusion. A 80% voting threshold is used to determine the morphology of each galaxy. Although such a high threshold is desirable, the outcome has significantly increased uncertainty instead of helping astronomers and cosmologists in their quest to unfold the facts about our universe.
