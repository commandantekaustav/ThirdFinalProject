    Data Analysis and Morphological Classification of Galaxies from SDSS

    Introduction:

Astronomy dates back as far as the ancient Indians, the Egyptians, the
Mayans, the Inkas and the Mesopotemians. Astronomy was used as a means
of keeping track of time and predicting future events which was achieved
through a combination of religion, astrology and the meticulous study of
the positions and motions of various celestial bodies. It is generally
believed that priests were the first professional astronomers, the
pioneers of the field. The real renaissance of astronomy began in the
1500s when Nicholaus Copernicus, a Polish university-trained Catholic
priest, mathematician and astronomer, proposed a heliocentric model of
our Universe in which the Sun, rather than the Earth, is in the center
of the Solar System. Figure in the left graphically illustrates this
model. Just before he died in 1543, he published a book entitled
\emph{De revolutionibus orbium coelestium (On the Revolutions of the
Celestial Spheres)} which became one of the most important contributions
towards the scientific revolution.

Terminologies:

\textbf{Galaxy:} A galaxy is defined as a populous system of stars,
dust, dark matter and gases that are all bound together by gravity.
There are numerous sizes that a galaxy can possess in terms of the
number of stars that live within it, ranging anywhere from 10 million to
10 trillion stars. There are two common general shapes that a galaxy can
take, either spiral or elliptical. Many variations within each also
exist as well as less-common shapes such as toothpicks or rings.
\emph{\textbf{Messier 64 (M64)} - A spiral galaxy, the result of a
collision between two galaxies. Due to the spectacular dark band of dust
surrounding the galaxy's bright nuclues, its been nicknamed by some as
the Evil Eye galaxy (credit: hubblesite.org).} \textbf{Star:} A star,
our Sun being a perfect example, is essentially a sphere of immensely
hot gas, mainly that of hydrogen, partly helium and with minute traces
of other various gases. Within its core, an incredible amount of energy
is generated through the process of fusion in which smaller atoms smash
together at great speeds to form larger atoms. Likewise with galaxies,
astronomers also have a process for classifying stars. They are grouped
into spectral types. By spectral, we refer to the temperature and
brightness of the surfaces of the stars. \textbf{Quasar:} a massive and
extremely remote celestial object, emitting exceptionally large amounts
of energy, and typically having a starlike image in a telescope. It has
been suggested that quasars contain massive black holes and may
represent a stage in the evolution of some galaxies.\emph{(Above figure
contains some of the clearest light views of quasar taken till date.)
(credit: nasa.gov)} \textbf{Morphology:} \textbf{\emph{Galaxy
morphology}} \emph{is a visual grouping system used by astronomers for
galaxy classification}. Almost a hundred years have now passed since it
was first discovered that galaxies were independent systems subjected to
morphology and mergers. \emph{The most famous system for morphological
classification, known as the} \textbf{\emph{Hubble Tuning Fork System}},
\emph{was proposed by American astronomer \textbf{Edwin Powell Hubble}
in the year 1936.} In 1936, when Hubble released his book Realm of the
Nebulae, that research in the area became abundant and the study of
galaxy morphology became a well established sub-field of optical
astronomy. Since then, there have been numerous studies and proposed
revisions to the \textbf{Fork Sequence} that have been published. Hubble
is generally regarded, in the field, as one of the most important
observational cosmologists of the 20th century who played an important
role in the establishment of the field of extragalactic astronomy.

Project Objectives:

Most of the galaxies in the Galaxy Zoo project are labelled as
Uncertain. This is partially due to the 80\% voting threshold used to
determine, with confidence, the morphology of each galaxy. Although such
a high threshold is desirable, the 1.3 Book Organisation 3 outcome has
significantly increased uncertainty instead of helping astronomers and
cosmologists in their quest to unfold the facts about our universe.
Thus, we aim to use intelligent data analysis techniques to resolve this
problem. An analysis of the Galaxy Zoo Table 2 classification data set
is carried out and an investigation into how to determine the categories
of those galaxies labelled as Uncertain using an unsupervised approach
is initiated. We also review the astronomical data mining landscape and
detail the progress that has been made thus far towards effective
classification in this field. The various algorithms that have been
utilised to this effect will be studied and its results briefly analysed
with particular focus being given to the K-Means clustering algorithm,
which is the cynosure of this book. The main research carried out here
centres on developing a heuristic technique towards attribute selection
in order to help further increase the overall accuracies of galaxy
classification, together with the utilisation of the K-Means algorithm,
in an unsupervised setting. The aim is to be able to provide astronomers
with a means to effectively assign each galaxy to the right category as
accurately and efficiently as possible.

\subsubsection{Data Excavation Sites:}\label{data-excavation-sites}

Datasets used this project are mined from the following servers; 1.
\textbf{\emph{GalaxyZoo1:}} Galaxy Zoo is a crowdsourced astronomy
project which invites people to assist in the morphological
classification of large numbers of galaxies. It is an example of citizen
science as it enlists the help of members of the public to help in
scientific research.There have been 15 versions as of July 2017, many of
which are outlined in this article. Galaxy Zoo is part of the
Zooniverse, a group of citizen science projects. An outcome of the
project is to better determine the different aspects of objects and to
separate them into classifications.

the public to help classify a million galaxies. Those involved are
directly contributing to scientific research, while getting an
opportunity to view the beautiful and varied galaxies that inhabit our
universe.Why do we need people to do this, rather than just using a
computer? The simple answer is that the human brain is much better at
recognising patterns than a computer. Galaxies are complicated objects
that vary in appearance enormously, and yet in some ways they can be
very similar. We could write a computer program to classify these
galaxies, and many researchers have, but so far none have really done a
good enough job. We have not been able to make computers `see past' the
complexity, to reliably identify the similarities that appear obvious to
our eyes and brain. For now, and probably for some time yet, people do
the best job of classifying galaxies.}" \textgreater{}

"\emph{Getting all these galaxy classifications is just the first stage
of our project. What we really want to do is some science, to try and
understand what kind of galaxies there are, how they formed, and the
processes that have changed them into the systems we see today. The
journey from raw classifications to accepted scientific results is often
long and arduous. In this blog we aim to explain the steps involved, and
the scientific ideas we are working on.}"

  \textbf{\emph{GalaxyZoo2:}} The original Galaxy Zoo consisted of a
  data set made up of ≈900,000 galaxies imaged by the Sloan Digital Sky
  Survey. With so many galaxies, it had been assumed that it would take
  years for visitors to the site to work through them all, but within 24
  hours of launch, the website was receiving almost 70,000
  classifications an hour. In the end, more than 50 million
  classifications were received by the project during its first year,
  contributed by more than 150,000 people. This was started in July 2007
  and retired in 2009. \textbf{GalaxyZoo2} consisted of some 250,000 of
  the brightest galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Galaxy Zoo 2
  allowed for a much more detailed classification, by shape and by the
  intensity or dimness of the galactic core, and with a special section
  for oddities like mergers or ring galaxies. The sample also contained
  fewer optical oddities. The project closed with some 60 million
  classifications
\item
  \textbf{\emph{Sloan Digital SkyServer}}(\emph{10th,12th and 14th
  release})\textbf{:} The Sloan Digital Sky Survey or SDSS is a major
  multi-spectral imaging and spectroscopic redshift survey using a
  dedicated 2.5-m wide-angle optical telescope at Apache Point
  Observatory in New Mexico, United States. The project was named after
  the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, which contributed significant funding.
  \textbf{\emph{Data collection began in 2000; }the final imaging data
  release (DR9) covers over 35\% of the sky,* with photometric
  observations of around nearly 1 billion objects, \emph{while the
  survey continues to acquire spectra, having so far taken spectra of
  over 4 million objects.}} The main galaxy sample has a median redshift
  of z = 0.1; there are redshifts for luminous red galaxies as far as z
  = 0.7, and for quasars as far as z = 5; and the imaging survey has
  been involved in the detection of quasars beyond a redshift z = 6.
  \emph{\textbf{Data release 8 (DR8)}, released in January 2011},
  includes all photometric observations taken with the SDSS imaging
  camera, covering 14,555 square degrees on the sky \emph{(just over
  35\% of the full sky)}. \textbf{\emph{Data release 9 (DR9), released
  to the public on }31 July 2012}\emph{, includes the first results from
  the }\textbf{Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS)}*
  spectrograph, including over 800,000 new spectra. Over 500,000 of the
  new spectra are of objects in the Universe 7 billion years ago
  \emph{(roughly half the age of the universe)}. \textbf{Data release 10
  (DR10), released to the public on 31 July 2013, includes all data from
  previous releases, plus the first results from the \emph{APO Galactic
  Evolution Experiment (APOGEE)}} spectrograph, including over 57,000
  high-resolution infrared spectra of stars in the Milky Way.
  \textbf{\emph{DR10 also includes over 670,000 new BOSS spectra of
  galaxies and quasars in the distant universe.}} \emph{The publicly
  available images from the survey were made between 1998 and 2009.}

\subsubsection{Mining Tools}\label{mining-tools}

Data can be easily mined from the skyserver by using their own sql based
search tool which is available at
\emph{https://skyserver.sdss.org/dr12/en/tools/search/sql.aspx }.
Observations can be checked manually using another tool from the
skyserver popularly known as the \textbf{voyage:}
\emph{http://cas.sdss.org/dr15/en/tools/chart/navi.aspx} and is widely
used by the educators and students from all over the world! or
\textbf{astrometry:} \emph{http://nova.astrometry.net/user\_images}
